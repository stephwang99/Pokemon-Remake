# Pokemon-vs1.0
A little remake of Pokemon using visual basic.
This was my first programming project. I learned VB first in school, and this was my final project for that class.
I really liked the game Pokemon so I decided to make a remake.
To make it go faster to look through, I made the tackle move automatically 'kill' the opponents.
All other moves make proper amount of damage.
